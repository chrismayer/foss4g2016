#Creating WebGIS Applications with GeoExt3

The Workshop will show how to create sophisticated WebGIS applications 
based on the latest version of the javascript library GeoExt.

The participants will get an introduction to the latest version and 
the tools needed to quickly setup and develop GeoExt3 Applications.
After an introduction and general information about the project, the 
workshop will shift its main focus to the development off an small 
application.
This is just the best way to get into GeoExt3. Learning by doing!
