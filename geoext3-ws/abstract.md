#Creating WebGIS Applications with GeoExt3

The Workshop will show how to create sophisticated WebGIS applications 
based on the latest version of the JavasScript library GeoExt.

The participants will get an introduction to the latest version and 
the tools needed to quickly setup and develop GeoExt 3 applications.
After an introduction and some general information about the project, the 
workshop will shift its main focus to the development of an example 
application.
This is just the best way to get into GeoExt3. Learning by doing!

**General information:**

GeoExt 3 [1] is based on the JavaScript framework ExtJS 6 [2] and the 
JavaScript mapping library OpenLayers 3 [3] and is under active development 
since summer 2015.

The workshop will be held by the GeoExt 3 core commiters Christian 
Mayer, Kai Volland and Johannes Weskamm, who have been working on 
GeoExt 3 since the first days.

Previous knowledge in JavaScript is welcome but not necessary.
